# ExitIntentPopup



It has following functionalties : 
On submitting this form:
● Show error if Email or checkbox value is blank.

● Successful submission: create cookie & auto close the popup.
● On Closing the popup(whether the form is filled or not) a cookie will be created.
● On refresh: if any of the above-created cookies(i.e. successful submission or close) are
present, then exit intent popup should not appear.

TODO :
 
The scope will be different here, instead of exit intent the popup should auto appear after 5 seconds.
